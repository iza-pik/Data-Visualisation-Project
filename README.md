#CODE COMMENTARY

For this data visualisation project I used Yahoo Finance API, from which I extracted stock data in .json format.

The data object was mapped to the app which is using Highcharts to display all objects in one chart. The options and colours have been customised and unit tests added.

I used Typescript in React, with Highcharts and Styled components libraries.

The app could be further expanded to include different types of charts, different data endpoints, connect to a database etc.
